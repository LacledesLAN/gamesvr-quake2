Fixed double+ rails to check to see if player hit was an enemy before adding it to number of players hit.
Fixed yes votes not clearing on mapvote fail.

r36:
Changed yes/no vote commands to not set the client's vote to yes or no until a vote is in progress.
Added new CVAR: 'cfgdir'. You may want to run multiple servers from the same directory. This allows you to set
  those servers up independently. Please note that you must have a logs, nav, ent, and hs folder in each cfg directory. This
  is changed to read from cfg directory instead of the game directory. Also the bot_detected.txt is now bot_detected.log
  and will be in your logs directory. Also this is a noset cvar and must be set from the command line when starting the server.
Mapvoting is now available via client menu. Also choosing yes or no to vote is in same menu.
Fixed mapvote client command to not exec during map voting for end of level.
Added End of Level map change vote to client menu.
