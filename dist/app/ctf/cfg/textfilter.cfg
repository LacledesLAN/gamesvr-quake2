# This file lists the words and phrases (text strings)
# that are filtered out by the chat and name filters.
#
# Any line that does not begin with an equal is ignored.
# By convention, a pound sign (#) is used to begin a comment.
#
# The server will automatically do a maximal match on any
# strings, so "dumbass" will be matched before "ass".
#
# If you do not want the filter to match a phrase, then precede
# the word with an exclamation point (!).  For example, if
# you want to filter the string "lag", but not the string
# "flag", then you would add the following filter lines:
# =lag
# =!flag
#
# This file is only read when the server is first started.
# If you change this file while the server is running, issue
# a "sv loadtextfilter" command to re-read this file.
