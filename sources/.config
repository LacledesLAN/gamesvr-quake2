# Q2PRO build time configuration file

### Server configuration ###

# Enable r1ch.net anticheat server interface.
CONFIG_ANTICHEAT_SERVER=y

# Enable local MVD recording and MVD/GTV server functionality. Use this for
# hosting a GTV-capable game server.
#CONFIG_MVD_SERVER=y

# Enable MVD/GTV client functionality. Use this for hosting a GTV relay server.
#CONFIG_MVD_CLIENT=y


### Common configuration ###

# Enable experimental variable server FPS support in server and client.
#CONFIG_VARIABLE_SERVER_FPS=y

# Enable debugging and developer code.
#CONFIG_DEBUG=y

# Don't link against zlib. Not recommended for client builds, since lack of
# zlib support breaks compatibility with servers running protocol 35.
#CONFIG_NO_ZLIB=y

# Don't handle ICMP errors on UDP sockets.
#CONFIG_NO_ICMP=y

# Don't print console text on standard output and don't read commands from
# standard input.
#CONFIG_NO_SYSTEM_CONSOLE=y


### Game directories ###

# Name of the game directory used as base game directory. Default value is
# "baseq2". Change this when creating a standalone game using Q2PRO engine.
#CONFIG_GAME_BASE=baseq2

# Name of the game directory used as default game directory. Default value is
# empty. This option sets the default value of "game" console variable. Change
# this for building a version of Q2PRO customized for particular game mod, e.g.
# "action".
#CONFIG_GAME_DEFAULT=


### System paths ###

# By default Q2PRO assumes per-user installation: all game content, configs and
# executable files are kept in the same directory tree. This configuration is
# easy for most users to set up, but not ideal from security standpoint.
#
# Uncomment the options below if you wish to install Q2PRO system-wide,
# separating static, executable and writable content into different trees with
# different permissions.  These options have no effect on Windows.

# Path to the game data tree. This is where all static, non-executable data
# lives (e.g., paks). This option sets the default value of "basedir" console
# variable. Default value of this option is "." (current directory).
#CONFIG_PATH_DATA=/usr/local/share/games/q2pro

# Path to the game libraries tree. This is where executable parts of all game
# mods live (e.g., game$(CPU).so files). This option sets the default value of
# "libdir" console variable. Default value of this option is "." (current
# directory).
#CONFIG_PATH_LIB=/usr/local/lib/games/q2pro

# Name of the directory where Q2PRO stores per-user data. Tilde at the
# beginning of the name is automatically expanded to user home directory at run
# time. Users running Q2PRO must have write permissions to this directory.
# This option sets the default value of "homedir" console variable. Default
# value of this option is "" (use basedir as homedir).
#CONFIG_PATH_HOME=~/.q2pro


### Options for cross-compiling. ###

# Force cpu type to CPU, instead of autodetecting it.
CPU=x86_64

# Force different utility names.
